# PINNs-Review
A Repository for my Academic Mini Project done in 2021.

# Abstract
Neural Networks are very powerfull tools and are being used in various fields. In this Project the application of Neural Networks in solving DIfferential Equations is explored.
I've studied the works of a Popular research paper - *"Physics Informed Neural Networks"*[[1]](#1) done by Raissi et al. and applied to a few Physics Related Problems that i've come across in my Academia.
